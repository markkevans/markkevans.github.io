    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is for all of the recruiters who call me at work, add me on Linkedin or send me speculative CV's / roles for my consideration. Lets call it a best practice guide for how I want to interact with you, follow this guide and I am sure we will get on well, ignore this guide and I will be sure to not deal with you at all no matter how good the candidate or the role might be.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The aim of this guide is to help both myself and the recruiters who wish to get in contact with me, after all we are all busy people right?</p>

<h2>LinkedIn</h2>


<p>Do not add me on LinkedIn as 'We have done business together' if we have not, I will reject your request and I will file a spam complaint.</p>

<p>If you want to work with me, send me details of why I should work with you and include some references that I can contact for feedback in the intiial message, if you don't hear back from me take that as a sign that I don't need your services at this time, try again in 3 months.</p>

<h2>Speculative CV's</h2>


<p>Do not send me speculative CV's for a candidate who "You don't want to miss out on". If I am not working with you then you are unlikely to know what I am recruiting for or if I am recruiting at all.</p>

<p>Any speculative CV's sent over will be considered a gift and will be treated as such no matter what terms you specify in your email, I do not accept your terms unless I explicity agree in writing.</p>

<h2>Constant Calling / Emailing</h2>


<p>Don't call me constanntly without leaving a message on my voicemail, if you want to talk with me then call me one, leave me a voicemail message on why I should call you back. If you don't receive a phonecall or email from me then please take that as a sign that I don't need your services.</p>

<p>If you send me an email, explain why I should work with you and how you operate and wait for me to reply. If no reply is received then consider that confirmation that I don't need your services at this time, try again in 3 months.</p>

<h2>Calling my team</h2>


<p>Do not call anyone who works for me to try and get them to put you through to me and do not call them offering an exciting new role, I do not work with recruiters / agencies who work in this way.</p>

<h2>Meetups</h2>


<p>I view all meetups organised by recruitment agencies as a business event rather than a meetup, please ensure you make it clear what benefit I will get from attending or from sending someone from my team.</p>
